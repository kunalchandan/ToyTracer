A Ray Tracer written in `Rust` I am very much enjoying this language, and I wanted to learn how to build a ray tracer.

## Focus

Focus will be on a minimum viable product and I will be looking to expand from there.

The current roadway is to profile the existing code and see what's happening since I haven't looked at it in well over 3 years.
